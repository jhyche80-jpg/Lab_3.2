#Reflectiion

1. How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?

  It made it easier to do hard coding and making the width and the height. It also heloed me make specific color choices and visualize that really needs to be done. This is something I will do again. 

2. What challenges did you encounter when aligning your code with the design specifications?

  A huge challenge was creating a vision from scratch. Honstley starting it wass the biggest problems as I had ideas but didnt know where to start . I will need to make a step by step process that highlights things to do based on importance 

3. How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a developer?
  The challenges will make coding easier as i am a hands on learner and by doing things over and over again , I can learn everything.
